I've decided to switch from using Cryogen to generate my static site to Hugo. I originally chose Cryogen as it was a static site generator that used Clojure and would allow for me to further my knowledge of the language -- however after using the framework I found that due to its lack of support It would be smoother for me to switch to a more popular static site generator. Hugo seemed like the obvious choice due to the many blogs I've seen implemented in it. The [paper mod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) also was a compelling attribute.
