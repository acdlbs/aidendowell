I'm a graduating senior at the University of Florida studying computer science. My biggest interests in the tech sphere are: GPU-accelerated computing, networks, sysadmin, functional programming and lisps.


### My time at the University of Florida
At UF, I have been active as the project manager of the VR Club. Through this role I’ve learned valuable skills in regards to working in groups, reducing scope creep and C# development. Here, I have helped work on a Boids simulation involving parallel GPU computing and Cuda programming. I have also taken courses in Data Structures/Algorithms, Operating Systems, Information Systems & Databases, Design Patterns, and Linear Algebra/Numerical Analysis.

### Professional experience 
I have interned as a Junior Software Engineer at Saga-IT. This opportunity allowed me to become more familiar with a variety of tools and software - from asp.net development, employing Web Accessibility Testing Tools in CI workflows, to developing a solution cache busting approach used on the Saga website.


### Outlook
What I love about software development is that it never becomes mundane. With an ever changing tech stack, solutions always require learning. I think that the most important skill I’ve learned during my time as a developer is the ability to know how to learn efficiently and effectively.
